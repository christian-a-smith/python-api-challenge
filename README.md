## About
In this project, we were tasked with randomly creating a large list of cities, pulling info on their weather from the openweathermap api, and visualizing correlations between their latitude and local weather conditions.
We were then tasked to narrow down this list of cities by looking for ideal weather conditions, and pulling info on the nearest hotels to these ideal locations through the geoapify api.

## Getting Started
Code is saved as a jupyter notebook file format.

## Installing
Open through the jupyter notebook interface to run this file. You will need to add your own API keys for geoapify and openweathermap for the code to run.
